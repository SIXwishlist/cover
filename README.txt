Cover is a content-driven blogging theme for WordPress.

== Description ==

Built on top of Automattic’s _s (Underscores) and bundled with Font Awesome, Cover allows you to focus on your writing. There are no sidebars to mess with, just a single column view of your content.

Cover is designed for any size screen. No matter the device, Cover always looks beautiful.

Drawing special attention to featured images, from the homepage to posts, category archives to pages, your blog is made uniquely yours. Of course, you don’t have to use images. Cover’s clean typography lets your writing stand on its own.

-- Full-width featured images --

When you use a featured image in Cover, it displays as a background image behind the title. Images taller than 600 pixels will be displayed full-screen.

-- Scalable vector icons --

Cover is bundled with Font Awesome v4.3, allowing you to include any of its icons on any post or page.

-- Built for Aesop Story Engine --

Cover was built from the ground up with ASE in mind. Break out of the content area with full-width components like images, galleries, maps, and more.

-- Put widgets in their place --

Cover puts your content first, exactly where it should be. But that doesn't mean you can't have widgets and menus, and that's where the overlay comes in.

The overlay is a full-screen menu and widget display. You can define two menus (a regular one and a social media one) and as many widgets as your little heart desires. You can also put a social menu in the footer.

-- Social menus --

So, about those social menus. All you have to do is create a menu with links to your favorite social media accounts, and Cover will do the rest. It will detect the URL of the site in question and display the appropriate icon*, courtesy of Font Awesome.

== FAQ ==

1. How do I set the background image behind the post title?
   
   When you use a featured image in Cover, it displays as a background image behind the title. Images taller than 600 pixels will be displayed full-screen.

2. Can I change the font size?
   
   Cover does not allow you to change the default font size. I recommend creating a child theme before making changes to the theme.
